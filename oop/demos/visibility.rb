#by default, all methods in Ruby classes are public - accessible by anyone. To crate private or protected methods you can do the following: 

class Heart
	def public_method
	end
	protected #all methods that follow will be protected methods
	def protected_method
	end
	def protected_method2
	end
	private #all methods that follow will be made private; not accessible for outside objects
	def private_method
	end
	def private_method2
	end
end
